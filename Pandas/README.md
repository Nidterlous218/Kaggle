# Notes for Pandas

## Description

This repository contains Python code about learning the Pandas.
I wouldn't call this as a technical blog but rather as a notes where I learned from Kaggle.

Included:
 - Creating, Reading, and Writing
 - Indexing, Selecting, and Assigning
 - Summary Functions and Maps
 - Grouping and Sorting
 - Data Types and Missing Values
 - Renaming and Combining.

There are some explaination about my understanding for the codes, I am still correcting and optimizing it.

Please correct me for any errors.
